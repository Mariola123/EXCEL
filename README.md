# EXCEL
My first projects in Excel. All data is fictitious.
The first project is a summary of end-of-year marks in mathematics.
I used the column chart and text functions and mathematical functions (średnia, licz.jeżeli, zaokr.góra,lewy, prawy, dł,szukaj tekst).
The second project concerns the list (revenues, margins and customers) for three cellular networks depending on the services offered.
I created the project using a table and a pivot chart. I used conditional formatting and designed cell style.
